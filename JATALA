The Mimosa Hostilis inner root bark has been personally harvested, treated, and packed. The soil contains no additional nutrients since Mimosa occurs naturally in this region. Comparatively, this makes our product the best available on the market. We do not include the trunk in our product and accordingly only believe in using the inner root bark.
